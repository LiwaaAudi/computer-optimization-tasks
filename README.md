## [Task 1](task1.ipynb)
Using Newtonâ€™s method choose x0 and find the root of the equation x+e^x=0 with accuracy 0.01. How many iterations needed?

## [Task 2](task2.ipynb)
Solve system of linear equations using Jacobi method with accuracy 0,1.

-3x + 2y - 6z = 14

4x - 5y + 2z = -3

7x + 9y + 3z = 14
